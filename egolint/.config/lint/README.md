# Linter configuration catalog

Each directory owns the native configuration for one language, file format, or
quality dimension. `egolint/.mega-linter.yml` maps MegaLinter descriptor keys to
these files explicitly, while `egolint/tasks/lint.yml` exposes focused commands
for local use.

Keep rules tool-native whenever possible. MegaLinter should orchestrate a
linter, not redefine its policy through opaque command-line overrides.

Configuration changes should include at least one matching fixture or a
documented reason why an executable fixture is impractical.

Tools outside MegaLinter are cataloged in
[`../toolchain/complementary-tools.json`](../toolchain/complementary-tools.json).
That manifest records native configuration paths, exact versions, applicability
markers, positive and negative fixture evidence, direct commands, and report
destinations. It does not replace native tool configuration.

Project-aware tools require every marker group in their applicability contract.
For example, a `pyproject.toml` without packaged `src/**/*.py` source does not
activate deptry, Vulture, interrogate, or complexipy. Fixture paths never count
as repository applicability.
